Very simple Python to write a new HTML page every few seconds and
the HTML tag "<meta>" used to make the browser reload the HTML.

The time stamp in the HTML reflects when Python updated the page.
Python updates the page at a random number (1 to 15) seconds.

The HTML page has the tag "<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="5">" in it.
That tells the browser to refresh the page every 5 seconds.

Since python is updating the page every now and again the time will be 
updated in the browser when the HTML page gets updated.

Use:
1. Put the "refreshingPage.html" python script in a directory.
2. Run "python refreshingPage.html" at the command prompt.
3. Open "refreshingPage.html" in a browser.
4. Watch the HTML update every now and again.
